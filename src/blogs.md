# Blogs

I like other people's blogs. Unlike centralized media, each blogs include an addition layer of expression. Personal blogs can be styled by the author.

I don't remember blogrolls. I am a highschooler. When blogrolls were popular, I was not reading blogs. So in honor of blogrolls I keep of roll of blogrolls.
