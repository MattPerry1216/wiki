# Tracking Books

[wanted](./st-wanted.md)

I currently have my book list on [My Library](https://mylibrary.io/) and [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com). 

Why both?

In My Library, I like the idea of the automatic metadata, in this case using ISBN. It is also private, but sharable. But most importantly, it isn't ugly like Goodreads.

Goodsread allows me to export and import booklists, which is important for later visualization. But its ugly, slow, and social. I will never share my Goodreads willingly.

I can't show progress on books, but that is manual so I don't want do.

## How to display 

I want to review my book reading whenever I want. Goodreads has yearly challenges, but the export csv feature is better.

Book notes can go in this wiki. Long form book reviews can go in articles.
