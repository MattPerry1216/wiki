# MIT Challenge

My version of the MIT Challenge. No time limit. The only driving force is preparing for college. 

## Differences

I am not doing Course 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering) like the original. I am attempting Course 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). This is a harder decision, as less of the required courses are available, so I plan to skip a lot.
