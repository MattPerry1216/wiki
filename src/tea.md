# Tea

Trying to understand tea, especially eastern teas.

## Types of Tea

- Green Tea
- Yellow Tea
- White Tea
- Wulong Tea (I incorrectly call it oolong as well)
- Red Tea (Western Black Tea)
- Dark Tea (hēi chá)

## Processing Terms

Withering is the process of laying tea leaves on mats (fabric or bamboo).

Fixing is the process of heating the withered to stop oxidation. This denatures the enzymes and keep the leaves green. Heating can happen multiple ways; steaming, pan roasting, or drum roasting.

Drying removed all moisture left after the other steps. Drying is always done last. Drying methods such as charcoal roasting, can add flavor to the final tea. 

Bruising is when the leaves are rolled or twisted. This breaks down the leaves for the oxidation.

Oxidation is a second withering to allow the tea to brown.

Fermentation is a when tea is allowed a second oxidation.

*Tea production can vary greatly so the next definitions are my best guess to the common description.*

## Green Tea

Green tea is withered, fixed, and dried.

Stopping oxidation keeps the leaves green. The exact method for fixing is one of the defining features of different types. Some teas are rushed to steamers after harvest. However, most pan roasted teas are withered longer.

### Japanese Green Tea

Sencha - The most common type of green tea in Japan. This is the everyday tea. It is steamed then rolled.

Fukamushi Sencha - A variation of Sencha that is steamed longer.

Gyokuro - The tea plants are shaded with a screen a couple weeks before harvesting. This causes higher levels of theanine and a darker color. Hand-picked Gyokuro is one of the highest graded teas.

Tencha/Matcha - Gyokuro that is not rolled is called Tencha. When Tencha is crushed into a powder (traditionally with a stone) it is called Matcha. 

Kabusecha - Similar to Gyokuro, Kabusecha is shaded from the sun for only about a week.

Bancha - Tea picked after the first flush is called Bancha. Made from firmer leaves and stems, Bancha is coarse.

Houjicha - Remains from the other types of tea are pan fried to create this brown tea.

Kukicha - Remains are steamed to make this lighter tea. It is graded based on the type of stems, stalks, or twigs.

Genmaicha - Bancha or Sencha mixed with roasted brown rice is called Genmaicha.

## Yellow Tea

Yellow tea is withered, fixed, wrapped, and dried.

Wrapping the tea in paper or cloth, causes the tea leaves to slowly break down chlorophylls. 

## White Tea

White tea, oversimplified, is withered and dried.

Without a fixing phrase, white tea can technically be oxidized. 

## Wulong Tea

Wulong tea is withered, bruised, oxidized, fixed, and dried.

Wulong is bruised by shaking or tumbling. This gentle process breaks the edges of the leaves, allowing oxidation to start. 

The oxidation step defines wulong. Wulong is semi-oxidized, which is a hard term to define. It is oxidized less than red tea. To stop oxidation, wulong is fixed.

## Red Tea

Red tea or black tea in the west, is withered, bruised, oxidized, and dried.

It is allowed to fully oxidize (another hard term), creating the black leaves, and the red finished drink.

Many Western black teas are crushed or rolled very tightly by machines in the bruising stage. This causes a stronger final brew, but generally decreases grade.

## Dark Tea

Dark tea is fermented tea. I prefer the term post-fermented, to remove confusion with oxidization. The tea is allowed to ferment wet, over varying amount of time.

Hei Cha, contains all fermented chinese teas such as Pu-erh (Pu'er). 

Pu'er is formed into pucks or bricks. 

While rare, Japanese teas can be fermented.

## Herbal "Tea"

### A short list of tisanes.

- Chamomile
- Peppermint
- Rosehip
- Rooibos
- Ginger
- Cinnamon
- Lemongrass
- Tulsi
- Rosemary
- Barley
- Oat
- Eucalyptus

## Final Thoughts

Tea is hard to categorize. I have not even explore differences in growing region, plant breeding, or age. I hope to keep this paged updated.
